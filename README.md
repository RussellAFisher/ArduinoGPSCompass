#Arduino GPS Compass

This is an adaptation of a Adafruit project https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-gps-jacket/wear-it?view=all

The code has been changed so that given GPS coordinates a 12 LED Neopixel ring will light up with the LED that coresponds to the direction towards the end-point. The color of the LED is determined by the distance from the end-point, and at this point the distances are arbitrary but go from red to white/green. 

The end goal of this project will be to implement it into my car so that the hardware is hidden and the neopixel ring is all that shows.
